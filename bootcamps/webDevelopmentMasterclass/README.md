### Introduction to Testing Servers
1. A testing server allows us to test web application locally rather than uploading to live production server.
1. The testing server is important because any issue can be resolved without causing disruptions on the live server. 
1. PHP and MySQL require a testing server to function
1. Client side languages do not require a testing server (HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript)
