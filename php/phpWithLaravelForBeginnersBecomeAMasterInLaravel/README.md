# Windows - Local Environment Setup
1. Several apps and programs are installed
    1. XAMPP
    1. Git
    1. VSCode or PHPStorm (form Adobe) as code editor
    1. Composer
    1. Node.js
1. When [installing Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation#installing-laravel), we can direct the working directory to the folder that we want to create the project and use `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^7.0 blog`. We have to ensure php and composer have been installed on the machine. Note that we can use "**GitBash**" to create a Laravel project on Windows machine.
1. On the other hand, we may use `composer global require laravel/installer` to install Laravel globally on the machine, so we can simply use `laravel new [projectName]` to start a new Laravel project in any directory.
1. If composer can't download the dependencies correctly, we can use `composer config -g repo.packagist composer https://packagist.org` to change the repo and try to create the project again.
