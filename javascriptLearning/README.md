1. `.push()` method for Arrays actually returns a value which is the length of the array after "push". For example, if we have an array with 3 elements, if we assign variable len to be `len = array.push(e)`. `len` gets not an array value but a number which is the length of the updated array. This is a similar in Python that if we assign an variable with the returned value of a method, the variable will be `None` value. 

1. keyword `return` cannot stop `.forEach()` loop in higher order function. If we'd like to stop the `for` loop during iteration with `return`, we must use a regular syntax.
