`.push()` method for Arrays actually returns a value which is the length of the array after "push". For example, if we have an array with 3 elements, if we assign variable len to be `len = array.push(e)`. `len` gets not an array value but a number which is the length of the updated array. This is a similar in Python that if we assign an variable with the returned value of a method, the variable will be `None` value.
