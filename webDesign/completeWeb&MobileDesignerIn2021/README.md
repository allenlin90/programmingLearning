## Sketching
### The Sketching Process
1. Be prepared
    1. Prepare tools beforehand, such as simple paper or pencil and tablet
    1. Define the goals
    1. Define who is the audience
    1. Time yourself by keeping a time limit and having little pressure
1. Start sketching
    1. Draw a frame for the device
    1. Start with more simple and redundant elements
    1. Move onto some more detailed interactions
    1. Annotate the sketches and keep the file and information safe
    1. Keep going
    1. Share the sketches
1. Refinement
    1. Add titles to the sketches
    1. Add annotations
    1. Use numbers or arrows to create the flow of using
        1. Page transition
        1. Interaction transition

### Sketching User Flow
1. We can use paper and pencil or tablets to map out and visualize the user flow. 
1. The instructor introduced **_Concepts_** App which is available on iPad, Android, and Windows. However, by the time of learning, the cross platform synchronizing is not available yet. 
1. To start the user flow, we can follow the following steps.
    1. Understand what to be drawn with the scope of this work. This can be a large journey or a simple interaction.
    1. Define starting point. This could be the exact starting point, middle of the journey, or the end of the process by reverse the workflow. 
    1. Define the next step which is the action to go after the starting point of this work.
1. When we create the flow, it the flow wouldn't be one liner and straight forward. It may be presented as a flowchart which has many scenarios.
