# Section 1: Getting started - Sketching, Inspiration, User Flows
## Sketching
### The Sketching Process
1. Be prepared
    1. Prepare tools beforehand, such as simple paper or pencil and tablet
    1. Define the goals
    1. Define who is the audience
    1. Time yourself by keeping a time limit and having little pressure
1. Start sketching
    1. Draw a frame for the device
    1. Start with more simple and redundant elements
    1. Move onto some more detailed interactions
    1. Annotate the sketches and keep the file and information safe
    1. Keep going
    1. Share the sketches
1. Refinement
    1. Add titles to the sketches
    1. Add annotations
    1. Use numbers or arrows to create the flow of using
        1. Page transition
        1. Interaction transition
    1. Add gestures if you want
    <img src="./images/touchGestures.png">

### Sketching User Flow
1. We can use paper and pencil or tablets to map out and visualize the user flow. 
1. The instructor introduced **_Concepts_** App which is available on iPad, Android, and Windows. However, by the time of learning, the cross platform synchronizing is not available yet. 
1. To start the user flow, we can follow the following steps.
    1. Understand what to be drawn with the scope of this work. This can be a large journey or a simple interaction.
    1. Define starting point. This could be the exact starting point, middle of the journey, or the end of the process by reverse the workflow. 
    1. Define the next step which is the action to go after the starting point of this work.
1. When we create the flow, it the flow wouldn't be one liner and straight forward. It may be presented as a flowchart which has many scenarios.

### Sketching User Flow 2
1. We start to reason for the interactions that users may take with the pages and components.

### Sketching User Flow 3
1. This part is about the structure and navigation of the product. For example, we can have a homepage or landing page for certain feature. 
1. The main topic here is the relationship between different sections (such as pages) and functions with extendable features. The flow of the product introduced here is an e-commerce site.
    1. Home page
    1. Cart (Saved items)
    1. Checkout

### Sketching User Flow 4
1. This part goes deeper to each component on the page layout and how would those items interact with the user for different purposes and guidance. 

### Sketching Tips
1. Be lean and agile but don't be afraid of messing up.
1. Keep the sketching files safe
1. Always be prepared
1. Communicate and share to team





## Inspiration
### How to Stay Inspired
1. Creativity should be contantly stimulated. <br> Everyone has and can train his/her creativity.
1. Talk to peers. <br> People may get inspired during chats and casual talks.
1. Study others. <br> We can understand the reasoning flow with the process of reasoning rather than simply duplicating the same job.
1. Surround with great design. <br> It can be good inspiration and reminder for designers. 
1. Stay educated on a variety of topics. <br> We don't need to be expert in different areas, but we can refer to different knowledge and mindset for creative solutions.
1. Design for yourself. <br> We can sometimes escape from the current tasks and projects and change to focus on something we have passion of. 
1. Travel and explore the world. <br> Push yourself off the comfort zone.
1. Just take a walk. <br> Walking can boost creativity according to research. When changing mode of body conditions, we can have more refreshments and "Ah Ha" moments. 

### How to Find Inspiration
1. [**_Dribbble_**](https://dribbble.com/) is a platform where designers share their arts and works.
1. [**_Pinterest_**](https://www.pinterest.com/) is similar to Dribbble, while it covers more areas and topics of design. 
1. [**_Behance_**](https://www.behance.net/) is more about graphic design. 
1. [**_pttrns_**](https://pttrns.com/) is more about the smaller items and components within designs, such as buttons.
1. [**_awwwards_**](https://www.awwwards.com/) provides many good designed website layouts.

## User Flows
### What Are User Flows?
1. A **_user flow_** is the steps that users take to acheive a meaningful goal.
1. The user flow starts from "what the user sees and what the user does" to "what the user sees next and what the user does next".
    <img src="./images/userFlow.png">
1. Process of doing userflow
    1. Define the purpose of userflow
    1. User flows should head in one direction
    1. Describe each of the steps

### Do's and Don'ts
1. These process and concepts would be repetitive and redundant in some way. However, it helps to make the flow clear and easy to understand.
1. User flow should be clear
    1. Don't make the user flow vague.
    1. The user flow description should be descriptive and meaningful. 
1. User flow should be one direction
    1. Don't create flow maps to represent a user flow.
    1. Create distinct flows for different purposes.
1. Keeping the details in user flow
    1. Don't miss the details.
    1. We should put the right amount of details

### Speed up Workflow with Components
1. In this section, we start to use **_Figma_** to create the art works and user flow. 
1. In this case, we start with registration process for a user on the app. 
1. We can use <kbd>Alt</kbd> and mouse left key on an object to duplicate it. 
1. When selecting an object, we can choose to create a component by the button on the top, or <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + k</kbd>. Therefore, when the mother object is modified all the components created from that will be modified at the same time. 
1. However, if we modified a child component, the one will not be synchronized when the mother componenet is modified. That is the mother component can only synchronize modification with components that are created from the object and identical to it.
1. We can rename multiple objects with <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> at the same time and use <kbd>Ctrl + g</kbd> to group them. 
1. After grouping the objects, we can use <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + k</kbd> to create other groups of components.

### Creating Our Own User Flows
1. We start to build the user flow in this part. 
1. Press <kbd>f</kbd> and drag to create a frame, which is the background/canvas and can be used to group components and smaller objects.
1. Besids "layout" tab, we can check all the components in the "assests" tab to look the local components that we create. 
1. Use detachment with <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + b</kbd>. This command will bundle all the objects we combine and create a new item. Besides, we can also save it as a component.
1. Use mouse right click on a component and select "Go to Main Componenet". It will redirect us to the mother component in the file.

### Creating Our Own User Flows 2
1. This part is to layout the user flow of searching a product. 
    <img src="./images/userflow2_searchingForProduct.png">
    
### Creating Our Own User Flows 3
1. This part is to layout the user flow of making a purchase. 
1. If we select multiple objects, we can use <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + h</kbd> to distribute the selected objects in the space evenly. We can also select it in the "Design" tab on the right panel.
    <img src="./images/userflow3_makingAPurchase.png">


## Sitemaps
### Introduction to Sitemap
1. Sitemaps are hierarchical diagrams that show how pages are organized.
1. We can start to build the sitemap right after the beginning of the project which can give us an overview of the whole work.

### Creating a Basic Sitemap
1. A sitemap object includes several components.
    1. Reference score - This is not neccessary, but could be useful when doing wireframe.
    1. Label - This is the name of the webpage.
        <img src="./images/basicSitemapitem.png">
1. The map can start from top to bottom or from left to right.
1. We can add legend to each page as tags or labels if it helps.
        <img src="./images/legendForSitemap.png">
1. There are mainly 2 types of sitemaps.
    1. Flat Sitemaps - this good for small to medium size product, such as from 10 to 100 pages. It's suggested that we don't go too deep for the tiers, as within 4-level, unless it's necessary.
        <img src="./images/flatSitemap.png">
    1. Deep Sitemaps - this is more suitable of large sites, as for hundreds of hundreds of pages, such as e-commerce or blogging sites.
        <img src="./images/deepSitemap.png">
1. Sitemaps can help strategically place content where users can find it. It results in the creation of your navigation and hierarchies of the product.

### Before you start
1. This part is to refer back to the sketches that we have made when reasoning the user flow. 
1. We can get most of the resources and recommended plugins from [here](https://github.com/allenlin90/programmingLearning/blob/master/webDesign/completeWeb%26MobileDesignerIn2021/zerotomastery.io%2B-%2BDesign%2BResources.pdf).
1. There are some plugins can be very useful when doing design. 
    1. Unsplash - One of the most well known open source image collection.
    1. Logo Creator - Providing samples and collection from other companies for materials and inspiration.
    1. Autoflow - Auto setting arrows by using <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select multiple objects and create arrows.
    1. Wireframe - Providing templates for common use routes and functions, such as login page.

### Create a Sitemap
1. If we group items as an object in a "**frame**", we can modify "**Auto Layout**" on the right hand panel to rearrange the width and height of the frame and the space between the  objects or items in the frame.
1. We can duplicate a single object in a group of objects by using <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + b</kbd> to "Detach Instance", so we can modify a single item in the group of objects. For example, we can copy one of items in "page container" template with <kbd>Ctrl + d</kbd>.
1. Note since we are using the template which has pre-set instances in the object. We can change its attributes easily by switching the property in "**instance**" on the right panel.
1. There are some useful hot keys and commands such as 
    1. <kbd>f</kbd> to create a "**frame**" directly.
    1. <kbd>h</kbd> to change mouse cursor to a hand that we can drag and move the view on the canvas.
    1. <kbd>v</kbd> to change mouse cursor to an arrow which we can use to select items and objects on the canvas.
    1. <kbd>Ctrl + d</kbd> to duplicate a selected item, object, or component. 
    1. <kbd>t</kbd> to modify text in a textbox or object directly.
1. After building the layout with multipel objects, we can select all of them and in "Design" tab on the upper right corner on the top to distribute the selected objects horizontally in the space. We can also use <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + Shift + h</kbd> after selecting the objects.
1. In this case, we start to use the first plug-in `auto-flow` which allows users to create arrow flows between objects by simply selecting 2 objects with <kbd>shift</kbd>.
    <img src="./images/sitemap1.png">

### Create a Sitemap 2
1. When users start to use the application, they may start from onboarding process, such as registration, rather than going to home page directly. 
1. In this case, we consider about the flows such as "login/registration" and "search" which are the main features of a e-commerce website.
1. After reasoning the user flow and possible functino, we can go further at some point to fill up the gap between each requirements.
    <img src="./images/sitemap2.png">

### Tips for Getting Started
1. Try to be focused on the main features.
1. Consider sitemap with website userflow. 
1. Use colors in sitemap to differentiate individual or separated components.
1. In the intial stage, the sitemap no need to be finished and perfect.
1. Sitemap is a visualized tool that helps to work on wireframes and accelerate the process.

### Build Your First Website
1. This section is introducing "sublime 3" and some basic configuration for using the text editor. 
1. Some HTML tags are introduced. Note that modern HTML files will have more meta data to respond to various types of devices and screen size. Besides, most of the modern text editors have the shorthand that we can create HTML boilerplate very easily.
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
1. As we start to build a HTML file, we can open it in a browser such as "Chorme".

### DEVELOPER FUNDEMENTALS: III
1. This section is introducing `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag. This declaration is to indicate the browser that the file is a HTML file. 
1. The lecturer also explains that how important the seaching and problem solving skill of programmers is.
1. W3CSchool is one of the good websites that we can learn fundementals of HTML. 

### HTML Tags
1. Though there are many different HTML tags for use, we use part of them in regular development.
1. `<h1></h1>` is `h1` header 1 tag. Note that header tags with different sizes are from **1** to **6**.
1. `<p></p>` is for paragraph tag.
1. We can use `lorem ipsum` for gibberish text to fill out the elements.
1. `<b></b>` is to make the text in the element **bold**, while `<i></i>` can make text italic. However, this is a legacy element that some devices and browesers don't support. We can use `<strong></strong>` to make text bold and `<em></em>` to make text italic. 

### HTML Tags 2
1. `<ul></ul>` is to make unordered list which we can wrap `<li></li>`. We can use `<ol></ol>` for ordered list that is with numbers. Besides, we can make nested list as well.
    ```html
    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2.1</li>
            <li>2.2</li>
            <li>2.3</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    ```

### Self Closing HTML Tags
1. Self closing tags are elements that has single element without a closing element with slash `/`.
1. `<hr>` is horizontal line.
1. `<br>` is a break that we can change the line of the content.
1. `<img>` is to refer to a image URL that we can put image to the page. Besides, it has some attributes.
    1. `src` is to link to the source of the image.
    1. `alt` is the alternative that shows the text when the image or link is not available, or the "description" of the image.
    1. `width` is to change the width of the image in case the size is too large to fit to the layout, element, or design.
    1. `height` is to change the height of the image.

### Anchor Tag
1. `<a></a>` has `href` attribute which stands for hyper text reference that can redirect the user to the appointed URL or destination. For example, the following anchor tag direct the user to the other page `newpage.html` in the same directory.
1. In addition, we can put other HTML elements in the anchor tag to create a special element to redirect users such as a button.
    ```html
    <a href="newpage.html">New Page</a>
    <a href="link.html">
        <h1>Link</h1>
    </a>
    ```

### Q&A: index.html
1. In convention, `index.html` is the default name of the homepage for the server to know that `index.html` is the homepage or the first page that the server should return when there's a request to the root directory which is the website URL. 

### Q&A: Relative vs Absolute Path
1. Relative page starts from the object that link to the other object, this is the shorthand rather than giving the whole path, which is the absolute path of the object. 
1. A URL link with HTTP or HTTPs is an absolute path. 

### HTML Forms
1. `<form></form>` is the form element that we can use it to collect user inputs.
1. There are several types of input and attributes we can use to build up the form tag. 
    1. `<input>`
        1. `text` is the regular input to collect text. 
        1. `email` has the basic validator to check if there's an `@` sign in the input.
        1. `password` will mask the input form the user with system default characters such as dots or asterisks `*`. Besides, we can use `min` attribute in this tag to indicate that how many characters are requried to set the password.
        1. `date` is a date picker that will show a system default calendar for users to choose the date.
        1. `radio` is single selection from multiple items. Note that we can use `name` attribute to group `inputs` that has the same `name` attribute.
        1. `checkbox` is a checkbox that returns boolean value as `true` or `false`.
        1. `submit` is to send the data in the form to the backend. 
        1. `reset` is to clear out all the inputs in the form tag.
    1. `name` is the attribute that we can use it to create variable to send requests to the backend, or group radio buttons so that the HTML file knows which radio buttons are in the same group. Thus, users can only select one of the options from the radio button list. 
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <form>
                First Name: <input type="text"><br>
                Last Name: <input type="text"><br>
                Email: <input type="email" required><br>
                Password: <input type="password" min="8" required><br>
                Birthday: <input type="date"><br>
                Gender: <br>
                <input type="radio" name="gender">Male<br>
                <input type="radio" name="gender">Female<br>
                <input type="radio" name="gender">Other<br>
                Pets: <br>
                <input type="checkbox"> Cat<br>
                <input type="checkbox"> Dogs<br>
                <input type="submit" value="Register">
                <input type="reset" value="Reset">
            </form>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

### HTML Forms 2
1. `<select></select>` tag can create a dropdown list for users to choose. There are some useful attributes on select tag as well. 
    1. `multiple` can make the select tag becomes multiple selection.
    ```html
    Cars: <br>
    <select multiple>
        <option>Volve</option>
        <option>Audi</option>
    </select>
    ```
