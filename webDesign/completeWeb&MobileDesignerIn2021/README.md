### Sketching User Flow






























### Sketching User Flow 3
1. This part is about the structure and navigation of the product. For example, we can have a homepage or landing page for certain feature. 
1. The main topic here is the relationship between different sections (such as pages) and functions with extendable features. The flow of the product introduced here is an e-commerce site.
    1. Home page
    1. Cart (Saved items)
    1. Checkout

### Sketching User Flow 4
1. This part goes deeper to each component on the page layout and how would those items interact with the user for different purposes and guidance. 

### Sketching Tips
1. Be lean and agile but don't be afraid of messing up.
1. Keep the sketching files safe
1. Always be prepared
1. Communicate and share to team

## Inspiration
### How to Stay Inspired
1. Creativity should be contantly stimulated. <br> Everyone has and can train his/her creativity.
1. Talk to peers. <br> People may get inspired during chats and casual talks.
1. Study others. <br> We can understand the reasoning flow with the process of reasoning rather than simply duplicating the same job.
1. Surround with great design. <br> It can be good inspiration and reminder for designers. 
1. Stay educated on a variety of topics. <br> We don't need to be expert in different areas, but we can refer to different knowledge and mindset for creative solutions.
1. Design for yourself. <br> We can sometimes escape from the current tasks and projects and change to focus on something we have passion of. 
1. Travel and explore the world. <br> Push yourself off the comfort zone.
1. Just take a walk. <br> Walking can boost creativity according to research. When changing mode of body conditions, we can have more refreshments and "Ah Ha" moments. 

### How to Find Inspiration
1. [**_Dribbble_**](https://dribbble.com/) is a platform where designers share their arts and works.
1. [**_Pinterest_**](https://www.pinterest.com/) is similar to Dribbble, while it covers more areas and topics of design. 
1. [**_Behance_**](https://www.behance.net/) is more about graphic design. 
1. [**_pttrns_**](https://pttrns.com/) is more about the smaller items and components within designs, such as buttons.
1. [**_awwwards_**](https://www.awwwards.com/) provides many good designed website layouts.

## User Flows
### What Are User Flows?
1. A **_user flow_** is the steps that users take to acheive a meaningful goal.
1. The user flow starts from "what the user sees and what the user does" to "what the user sees next and what the user does next".
    <img src="./images/userFlow.png">
1. Process of doing userflow
    1. Define the purpose of userflow
    1. User flows should head in one direction
    1. Describe each of the steps

### Do's and Don'ts
1. These process and concepts would be repetitive and redundant in some way. However, it helps to make the flow clear and easy to understand.
1. User flow should be clear
    1. Don't make the user flow vague.
    1. The user flow description should be descriptive and meaningful. 
1. User flow should be one direction
    1. Don't create flow maps to represent a user flow.
    1. Create distinct flows for different purposes.
1. Keeping the details in user flow
    1. Don't miss the details.
    1. We should put the right amount of details

### Speed up Workflow with Components
1. In this section, we start to use **_Figma_** to create the art works and user flow. 
1. We can use <kbd>Alt</kbd> and mouse left key on an object to duplicate it. 
1. When selecting an object, we can choose to create a component by the button on the top, or <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + k</kbd>. Therefore, when the mother object is modified all the components created from that will be modified at the same time. 
1. However, if we modified a child component, the one will not be synchronized when the mother componenet is modified. That is the mother component can only synchronize modification with components that are created from the object and identical to it.
1. We can rename multiple objects with <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> at the same time and use <kbd>Ctrl + g</kbd> to group them. 
1. After grouping the objects, we can use <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + k</kbd> to create other groups of components.
